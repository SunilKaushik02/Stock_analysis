# Stock_analysis
Trying to come up with strategies to work with the market movements and hopefully make some money.

**Strategy 1**: I tried to analyze if years where elections takes place effects the movements of stock prices? 
**Results**: There were some months post and pre election results announcements where market moved ~5% and can be used as a strategy to wager on the opposite side where the market is moving. 

**Strategy 2**: Go against the market direction i.e write call options when market is at an all time high and write put options when market is at 5 yr lows 
**Results**: Writing options is the boldest and most effective strategy because a person can be profitable when market moves in the direction of position or if it moves sideways (reduction in time value is the hidden secret!!!!)
