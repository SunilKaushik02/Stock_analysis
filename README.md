# Stock_analysis
Trying to come up with strategies to work with the market movements and hopefully make some money.

**Strategy 1**: I tried to analyze if years where elections takes place effects the movements of stock prices? 
**Results**: There were some months post and pre election results announcements where market moved ~5% and can be used as a strategy to wager on the opposite side where the market is moving.
